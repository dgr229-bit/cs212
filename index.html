  <h2>Role: Federal Police Officer</h2>

  <p>
    Hello, my name is Daniel G. Rayos. I am currently a full-time Police Officer at Marine Corps Air Station Yuma.
    I am originally from Las Cruces, New Mexico but have lived in Yuma for 10 years now. I am a Marine Corps Veteran
    of 4 years and it’s earned me future employment with the Marine Corps as a military police officer.
    I picked my major as cyber security. I have very limited skills as of now with HTML and I am currently trying
    to learn everything I can. I hope to learn a lot from this course and hope to continue doing good in this course.
